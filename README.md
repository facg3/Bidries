# Birdies

## What is Birdies?
Birdies is a small team building the portfolio linked in this repo as a practice to improving our team's of FACG3 skills in web development.

The four Birdies are
Mohammad mortaja
Marwa al beltaji
Nadia al khatib
Noureldean swearky

## Whait ... why?
Simply in order to scale up our skills in pair programming and in web development field. Every coder's dream.

Having lots of help from Founders & Coders along with GazaSkyGeeks was a great push forward. But the most important was having each other mentoring one another, sharing our knowledge one another, collecting the harvest of others alongside ours.


## How did we do it?
The lack of experience had pushed us into swimming in chaios for the past two days. We divided the page into four main parts (navagation bar, body, contact and footer) and gave each one the work to accomplish. Later we faced the problem of merging our small projcets together. But we kind of did it.

## Plan:
Nadia: I worked the navagation bar.

Mohammad: I did the body with the image and the title.

Marwa: I designed the brief paragraph about eache one alongside the contact us.

Nour: The footer was mine.
